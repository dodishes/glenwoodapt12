You now own a copy of the repository code, and you should have a live website up at yourgithubusername.github.io/websheet

The only thing left to do is hook up the Google spreadsheet that contains the data you would like to display.

* Switch your repository to the gh-pages branch by clicking Branch -> gh-pages

* To change the logo title of your webpage, edit the "page-title.txt" file in your newly created repo

## Displaying Data in Rows

Your data will not display properly in rows on the homepage until you choose which columns from your spreadsheet to include. To include a column, wrap the column value in [], i.e. [Name], [Date of Birth], [Status]. Now the rows on your homepage will display the data for the Name, Date of Birth, and Status columns.
